    <h2>What is Acting?</h2>
      <p><strong>Acting</strong> can be thought of as the study of the <em>human emotion</em> of a character in a story. To be able to feel and express these emotions as a form of entertainment is the goal of acting. </p>

    <h2>History of Acting</h2>
      <p>Acting is not a recent concept that modern humans thought of. Ever since man walked the Earth, acting has always been practiced. For example, imitation can be thought of as a form of acting when early humans would imitate animals' characteristics. It wasn't until around the 1800s that acting became specialized. Below is a table of some of the famous actors and the country where they revolutionized acting. </p>

Release 1

A website similar to the one I created is located here:

http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/s12/gair_j/

What makes this site is good is the layout of it. The layout of the website is much easier and pleasant to read. With the colors and frames, they help give the website style.

I also recognize most of the HTML elements used. This includes <p>, <h1>, <nav>, <strong>, <footer>, and many more. There are also some elements that I have not encountered on there. <figure class=""> is most likely used to put in figures and <iframes> is to set the width and height of the video.

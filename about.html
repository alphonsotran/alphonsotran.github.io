    <p>Alphonso's recent passion for acting has made him thirsty for the art. Born in 1986 in the tropics of South America, he has traveled the world to gain insight in the knowledge of acting. He has searched high and low for members of the legendary Actor's guild, who are known to be hermits. Alphonso had accepted the fact that getting them to act to reveal their techniques in front of an audience would be a difficult feat. This is why he made this webpage to make sure that no other aspiring actor will have to go through the traumatic trials that he had to endure.</p>
